This code is a python script which takes an input file that contains schedule table. 

Steps used to find ideal frame size: 
- Find potential frame sizes using two frame constarints: 	
	i) H/f-floor(H/f)=0 for atleast one f value 
	ii)2f-gcd(pi,f)<=Di for all i values. 
	Here, f= frame size, H= hyper period. 
- Utilized the concept of Network flow algorithm for computing Static schedules. 
- For finding max-flow in the network graph, I used adjacency matrix to determine it. 

Input1 has synchronous tasks. 
Input2 has asynchronous tasks. 

To run: 
	-python code1.py
	-python code2.py
